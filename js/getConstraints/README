I built this using SpiderMonkey, and the script to run it assumes you've got 
the SpiderMonkey shell on your path. You can get and build SpiderMonkey pretty
easily from Mozilla's website (see 
https://developer.mozilla.org/En/SpiderMonkey/Build_Documentation) but it was
already installed on my distribution of Fedora.

Anyway, to run the things, just run one of the following:

getConstraints.sh <filename>     -- outputs constraints contained in file
getConstraints.sh -t             -- run tests in getContraintsTests.js

getConstraintTree.sh <filename>  -- outputs constraint tree of file
getConstraintTree.sh -t          -- run tests in getConstraintTreeTests.js
